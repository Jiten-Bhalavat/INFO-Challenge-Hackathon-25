Identifying Capstone Officials â€“ United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has required that all Federal Agencies use the Capstone approach to manage their email records, USDA being one. The Capstone approach is known as preserving email records based on the position or role of the email account owner and requires that the emails associated with the defined positions are considered permanent. Those considered Capstone Officials are those on higher organizational charts, helping them to be put into the system easier. However, with approximately 650 positions and 14 agencies, the Capstone officials at USDA are having difficulties with being identified within the system by Human Resources (HR). Students will create an algorithm that will automatically identify and report Capstone Official data for Records Management compliance.
